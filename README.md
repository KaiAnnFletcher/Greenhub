# Kaibru

*Project Description:* 
Kaibru specifically is being designed as a one-stop hub for users to browse sustainable products and services.

This is our beta release which means that there is still work to be completed on this project.

The first website is featured using webscraping and we have ensured that there are links which route back to the original website.

*Challenges:*
Web-scraping is proving to be a challenge currently. Due to an issue with undefined attributes we had to switch our back-end from Sequelize to MongoDB. Even still we are only

able to feature links for the first website. In future we will be looking toward open APIs instead. Again, this is our beta release - the platform will be undergoing major

changes in future for a more user-friendly interface.

*Core Responsibilities:* 
Kai-Ann Fletcher - Principal Developer

Bruno Mazzitelli - Lead Visionary and Content Strategist

*Tools/languages used:* 
HTML5, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.js, MonogDB, JWT, web-scraping (cheerio)
